# Variadic Functions

This project contains functions that make use of variadic functions in C.

## Files

- `0-sum_them_all.c`: A function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
- `1-print_numbers.c`: A function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
- `2-print_strings.c`: A function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
- `3-print_all.c`: A function that prints anything.
- `variadic_functions.h`: Header file containing the function prototypes.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- Code should use the Betty style (checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl)
- No global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free, and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc. is forbidden
- Allowed to use the following macros: va_start, va_arg, and va_end
- Allowed to use _putchar
- Do not push _putchar.c
- Function prototypes and _putchar prototype should be included in a header file called variadic_functions.h
- All header files should be include guarded
