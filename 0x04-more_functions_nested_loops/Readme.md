# 0x04. More Functions, More Nested Loops

This project is part of the ALX low-level programming curriculum. It focuses on understanding and implementing functions and nested loops in C.

## Tasks

1. **isupper**: Write a function that checks if a character is uppercase.
   - Prototype: `int _isupper(int c);`
   - Returns 1 if the character is uppercase, 0 otherwise.

## Requirements

- All files must be written in C.
- The project should be compiled using `gcc` with the following flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- The project must follow the Betty style for code formatting.

## How to Compile

To compile the code, run the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-isupper.c -o 0-isuper
