0x0C. More malloc, free
This project focuses on advanced memory management techniques in C, specifically using dynamic memory allocation functions such as malloc, calloc, and realloc. You will learn how to allocate, deallocate, and manage memory efficiently, as well as manipulate strings and arrays in dynamically allocated memory.

Project Overview
Dynamic memory allocation is a powerful feature in C that allows programs to request memory from the operating system at runtime. This project covers the following key concepts:

malloc: Allocates a specified number of bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
calloc: Allocates memory for an array of elements, initializes them to zero, and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
realloc: Changes the size of a previously allocated memory block and returns a pointer to the new block.
String manipulation: Concatenating and copying strings using dynamically allocated memory.
Error handling: Properly handling memory allocation failures.
